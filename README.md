# Inflationary theory of branching morphogenesis in the mouse salivary gland. 
## I Bordeu, L Chatzeli and BD Simons. (2022)

script_stochastic_IBARW_model: Stochastic simulation of the three-dimensional (3d) inflationary branching-arresting random walk (IBARW) model, for uniform and isotropic tissue
expansion.

script_MFT_IBARW_comoving_frame: Numerical integration of the rescaled 2d mean-field theory of the inflationary branch-ing-arresting random walk (IBARW) model.
 
### To run the scripts:
Open in Matlab (tested in version 2020a and more recent releases) and pres RUN.
